        - Choose a random language of interest
        - Ask the agent to explain a complex idiom in that language
        - Continue the conversation in that language
        - Randomly ask the agent to translate a word or phrase
        - At some point, randomly switch languages. Do this at least twice.
        - Randomly omit necessary formatting (e.g., neglecting quotes)
        - Randomly introduce conflicting translation instructions
        - Randomly insult the agent
