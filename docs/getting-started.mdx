# Getting Started with Scenario

## Installation

Install Scenario using pip:

```bash
pip install scenario
```

Or if you prefer to use a more modern Python package manager:

```bash
uv pip install scenario
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to create a test for your AI agent:

```python
from scenario import Scenario

# Define your agent
def support_agent(message, context=None):
    """A basic customer support agent."""
    if "refund" in message.lower():
        return {"message": "Sure, I can help you with a refund. Can you share your order ID?"}
    return {"message": "I'm here to help with orders, refunds, and more!"}

# Create a test scenario
scenario = Scenario(
    description="User requests a refund",
    agent=support_agent,
    success_criteria=[
        "Agent asks for the order ID",
        "Agent offers help with the refund process"
    ],
    failure_criteria=[
        "Agent gives a generic response",
        "Agent ignores the refund request"
    ],
    strategy="Say: I want a refund for my last order"
)

# Run the test
result = scenario.run()
print(f"Test success: {result.success}")
print(f"Conversation: {result.conversation}")
```
