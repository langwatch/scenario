# Getting Started with Scenario

This guide will help you get up and running with Scenario to test your conversational agents.

## Installation

Install Scenario using pip:

```bash
pip install scenario
```

Or if you prefer to use a more modern Python package manager:

```bash
uv pip install scenario
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to create a test for your conversational agent:

```python
import scenario

def test_simple_conversation():
    # Define a test scenario
    test = scenario.Scenario(
        name="Simple greeting test",
        description="Tests if the agent responds appropriately to a greeting"
    )
    
    # Add a test case
    test.add_test_case(
        input="Hello, how are you?",
        expected_output_contains="I'm doing well"
    )
    
    # Run the test against your agent
    agent = scenario.TestingAgent(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
    )
    
    # Execute the test
    result = test.run(agent)
    
    # Assert that the test passed
    assert result.passed
```

## Using with pytest

Scenario integrates seamlessly with pytest:

```python
import pytest
from scenario import agent_test

@agent_test
def test_agent_greeting(testing_agent):
    """Test that the agent responds appropriately to a greeting."""
    response = testing_agent.chat("Hello, how are you today?")
    assert "doing well" in response.lower() or "good" in response.lower()
```
